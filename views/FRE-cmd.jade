          p Its dock icon looks like <img src="/images/mac-term-icon.png">, and the terminal will look something like <img src="/images/mac-term.png">
          p You can use the terminal to write commands to your computer (this is the “command line”). Let’s try it out!
          
          p In your terminal, type
          cli
            code ls
          p and hit enter.
          p The <code>ls</code> command, short for “list”, tells your computer to list all of the file names for the folder you’re in. Your list of files probably includes “Desktop” and “Documents”, among others. Let’s try another command: type
          cli
            code cd Documents
          p and hit enter.
          p You are now in the Documents folder; <code>cd</code> means “change directory”. If you try <code>ls</code> again, you should see the contents of your Documents folder listed out. If you want to compare, open up Finder and look in Documents to see the same files.
          p Let’s get back to the folder we were in before:
          cli
            code cd ..
          p You changed directory again!
          cli
            code ls
          p to see what we have here. You’re back where you started! The <code>..</code> after <code>cd</code> tells it to go up one folder in the directory.

          p Ok, now you're a cool hacker who can use the terminal (or "console") to write in the command line. (If you want to learn more commands, there are a whole bunch of them <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/" target=1>here</a>. I recommend <code>pwd</code>, <code>open</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>touch</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>cp</code>.)

      p Using Tessel is just like web development. But if you're not familiar with web development, you might want to take a minute or two to get comfortable with some key tools of the trade: the command line (the "terminal", where you execute commands) and the text editor, where you will work on and save your programs.

      p Select the operating system you are working on.

      dl#install-tabs(class="tabs contained three-up" data-tab)
        dd.active
          a#osx-tab(href="#tab-osx" data-toggle="tab" ) OSX
        dd
          a#linux-tab(href="#tab-linux" data-toggle="tab") Linux
        dd
          a#pc-tab(href="#tab-pc" data-toggle="tab") Windows

          p Open up the application on your computer called “Terminal” by pressing ⌘ + SPACE and typing “Terminal”.
          p Its dock icon looks like <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/technicalmachine-assets/fre+assets/mac-term-icon.png">, and the terminal will look something like <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/technicalmachine-assets/fre+assets/mac-term.png">
          p You can use the terminal to write commands to your computer (this is the “command line”). Let’s try it out!
          
          p In your terminal, type
          cli
            code ls
          p and hit enter.
          p The <code>ls</code> command, short for “list”, tells your computer to list all of the file names for the folder you’re in. Your list of files probably includes “Desktop” and “Documents”, among others. Let’s try another command: type
          cli
            code cd Documents
          p and hit enter.
          p You are now in the Documents folder; <code>cd</code> means “change directory”. If you try <code>ls</code> again, you should see the contents of your Documents folder listed out. If you want to compare, open up Finder and look in Documents to see the same files.
          p Let’s get back to the folder we were in before:
          cli
            code cd ..
          p You changed directory again!
          cli
            code ls
          p to see what we have here. You’re back where you started! The <code>..</code> after <code>cd</code> tells it to go up one folder in the directory.

          p Ok, now you're a cool hacker who can use the terminal (or "console") to write in the command line. (If you want to learn more commands, there are a whole bunch of them <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/" target=1>here</a>. I recommend <code>pwd</code>, <code>open</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>touch</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>cp</code>.)

      p You will also need a text editor to save your JavaScript files.
        | This means a plaintext editor, not a Word document.
      p Here are some good options:
        ul
          li
            a(href="http://www.sublimetext.com/") Sublime Text
          li
            a(href="https://atom.io/") Atom
          li
            a(href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/") Notepad++
      
      p Typically, directions that belong in the command line are one line, whereas longer scripts, such as anything in JavaScript, should be typed into the text editor and saved, then run through the command line.
      p In the context of this tutorial, things that should be run in the command line look
      cli
        code like this
      p And scripts that should be saved in the text editor will look
      pre.prettyprint
        code like this

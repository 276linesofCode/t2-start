<h1>Command Line Basics</h1>
<p>Using Tessel is just like web development. But if
you're not familiar with web development, you might want
to take a minute or two to get comfortable with some key
tools of the trade: the command line (the "terminal",
where you execute commands) and the text editor, where
you will work on and save your programs.</p>
<p>Select the operating system you are working on.</p>

    <p>Open up the application on your computer called

     , and the terminal will look something like

    </p>
    <p>You can use the terminal to write commands to your
    computer (this is the “command line”). Let’s try it
    out!</p>
    <p>In your terminal,
    type</p><kbd><code>ls</code></kbd>
    <p>and hit enter.</p>
    <p>The <code>ls</code> command, short for “list”,
    tells your computer to list all of the file names for
    the folder you’re in. Your list of files probably
    includes “Desktop” and “Documents”, among others.
    Let’s try another command: type</p><kbd><code>cd
    Documents</code></kbd>
    <p>and hit enter.</p>
    <p>You are now in the Documents folder;
    <code>cd</code> means “change directory”. If you try
    <code>ls</code> again, you should see the contents of
    your Documents folder listed out. If you want to
    compare, open up Finder and look in Documents to see
    the same files.</p>
    <p>Let’s get back to the folder we were in
    before:</p><kbd><code>cd ..</code></kbd>
    <p>You changed directory
    again!</p><kbd><code>ls</code></kbd>
    <p>to see what we have here. You’re back where you
    started! The <code>..</code> after <code>cd</code>
    tells it to go up one folder in the directory.</p>
    <p>Ok, now you're a cool hacker who can use the
    terminal (or "console") to write in the command line.
    (If you want to learn more commands, there are a
    whole bunch of them <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/"
    target="1">here</a>. I recommend <code>pwd</code>,
    <code>open</code>, <code>mkdir</code>,
    <code>touch</code>, <code>mv</code>, and
    <code>cp</code>.)</p>

<p>You will also need a text editor to save your
JavaScript files. This means a plaintext editor, not a
Word document.</p>
<p>Here are some good options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime
    Text</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, directions that belong in the command line
are one line, whereas longer scripts, such as anything in
JavaScript, should be typed into the text editor and
saved, then run through the command line.</p>

<p>In the context of this tutorial, things that should be
run in the command line look</p><kbd><code>like
this</code></kbd>

<p>And scripts that should be saved in the text editor
will look</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>like this</code>

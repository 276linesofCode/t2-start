# t2-start

This is a forked version of start.tessel.io that has the goal of becoming a book for the Tessel 2 "Getting Started" guide.

It's statically published as a GitHub page at this URL: http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/

Code is messy as this was scraped originally from a dynamic webapp. Goal is to have a clean, but static publishing system.
